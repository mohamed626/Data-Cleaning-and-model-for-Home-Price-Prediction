# Data-Cleaning-and-model-for-Home-Price-Prediction
This data science project series walks through step by step process of how load data set (banglore home prices dataset which i download it from kaggle.com) and cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, gridsearchcv for hyperparameter tunning, k fold cross validation and then build a model using many supervised learning and compear which one have high accuracy, i find the linear regression model have high accuracy, Technology and tools wise this project covers, 
1) Python
2) Jupyter notebook
3) Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
4) Matplotlib for data visualization
5) Sklearn for model building

# Data Science 
1) download data set (banglore home prices data set) from Kaggel.com
2) load banglore home prices data set into pandas dataframe and than handle NA values.
3) remove some unnecessary features and also normalize property size. 
4) convert the range of property size (such as 2100-3250) into an average of min and max (outlier detection and removal)
5) feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, gridsearchcv for hyperparameter tunning, k fold cross validation 

# model 
--I applay many supervised models 
1) linear regression model with accuracy 0.86
2) SVM for regression with score 0.66
3) DecisionTreeRegresso with score 0.70
